 # Swift Codable Examples
 Examples demonstrating transformation between JSON and Swift native types using  swift4 Codables. Each chapter looks at various use cases.
 
 - [The Basics](The%20Basics)
     - The examples introduce the Swift Encodable and Decodable protocols
  - [Date](Date)
     - The example discuss the use of built in `Date` encoders/decoders
 - [Simple Custom Codable Type](Simple%20Custom%20Codable%20Type)
     - The examples discuss the use of nested `Codable` types
 - [Introduction to Codable Keys](Intro%20to%20Codable%20Keys)
     - The examples introduce the `CodableKey` protocol and how you can use it to specify the mapping of JSON-native properties
 - [Containers](Containers)
     - The examples introduce the concept of `Containers` includeing `KeyedContainer`, `UnkeyedContainer` and `ValueContainer`
 - [Changing Types](Changing%20Types)
     - The examples demonstrate how you can change the type of a property to an appropriate native type when it is tranformed to a swift type and back
 - [Flattening Types](Flattening%20Types)
   - The examples demonstrate how you can flatten a nested JSON object when converting to native type
 - [Associative Enums](Associative%20Enums)
     - The examples demonstrate the encoding / decoding of a swift associative enum type to correpsonding JSON types
 - [Subclasses](subclasses)
      - The examples demonstrate the encoding/decoding of native subclasses to corresponding JSON types
 - [Dynamic Coding Keys](Dynamic%20Coding%20Keys)
      -  The examples demonstrate the encoding / decoding JSON objects that hold dynamic set of keys
 - [Context](Context)
      -  The examples demonstrate the use of context data for encoding/decoding
 - [All Together](All%20Together)
     -  A more complete example that puts together all the concepts showcased in previous examples
